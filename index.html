      <h1>What is BMI?</h1>
      <p>BMI is a measurement that uses an individual's weight and height to estimate body fat. It's calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters (BMI = weight / height^2).
        <br>BMI is commonly used as an initial screening tool to categorize individuals into weight categories: underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.</p>
         <h2>BMI Categories:</h2>
         <p>Underweight: BMI less than 18.5<br>
            Normal Weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9<br>    
            Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9<br>
            Obese: BMI of 30 or greater</p>
            <h3>Maintaining a Healthy BMI and Fitness Level:</h3>
            <p>Balanced Diet: Consuming a balanced diet with adequate nutrients is crucial for maintaining a healthy body. <br>
                Regular Exercise: Engaging in physical activities helps in managing weight, improving cardiovascular health, and boosting overall fitness.<br>
                Consulting Healthcare Professionals: Seeking guidance from healthcare providers, nutritionists, or fitness experts can assist in creating personalized plans for weight management.</p>
